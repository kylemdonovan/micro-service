A: How to request data

```User enters a 'y' in order to request a number to be generated and sent to the location yet to be determined. User can opt out of the number request by submitting 'n'.```

B: How to receive data

```The program will receive and process either the file or the contents of the file that is sent. If the user opted out of number generating, then the program will not be able to receive the number (unless I set a file and create a number 0 to be stored and then update...but that is beyond the scope of this assignment for now (but we can do that if it helps))```
